In this preview I am showing the image I chose as well as the positioning of the text. This is most definitely a “preview” in the sense that I have not been able to 
change the background color around the ice cream or change the font of the text. I wanted to first focus on placement before moving forward. I am still going a bit back 
and forth on the placement of “self”, and I also feel that “treat” could certainly be made larger, but again, I was focusing more on positioning. I really like this picture 
because of the way the ice cream is melting, which aligns with my original vision. I noticed though, that GIMP is a bit sticky when it comes to rotating text. I did not 
include any rotation in my preview; however, I did test out this feature. I am not super pleased with the way it rotates letters; however, I could have been rotating a bit 
improperly, and I am going to continue to play with the tool while also thinking of a plan incase I cannot rotate the text in a way that suites the argument. I also need 
to decide on a text color that will suite the image and present itself immediately to viewers. I am thinking potentially a shade of black or gray, but I am still deciding. 
In terms of the “background”, I created a layer with a shade of pink that I would like to use to replace the current color surrounding the hand and ice cream, however, I am 
struggling a bit with how to go about this. I need to spend additional time on this part specifically to find the best way to present the pink around the hand and ice cream. 
I hope to discuss this with my professor and classmates soon as well. I also need to go back and refresh my knowledge on a few of the LinkedIn Learning tutorials. 
I am looking forward to continuing to work on this project!
