My visual argument is centered around the common phrase "Treat Yourself". This phrase is all about celebrating you! Everyone deserves to be celebrated.
This phrase is something I find myself saying and acting on from time to time. I wanted to represent this through images and fonts. When I hear 
"Treat Yourself", I immediately think of sweet treats, hence the treats in my piece. I look forward to my viewers taking in each component of my visual argument,
and remember to treat themselves! I hope you enjoy my piece!
