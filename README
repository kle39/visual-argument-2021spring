My piece is centered around the idea of treating oneself, or in other words, celebrating you. When I hear the phrase “treat yourself”, 
I immediately think of common ways I enjoy treating myself, specifically, through ice cream. As of right now, I am planning to title my piece “The Sweet Life”. 
Life has so many sweet moments to offer, and we as humans have so many moments to celebrate ourselves. Peer reviewers can use the argument that a form of self-treating 
may look different for everyone, however, this visual is based off my associations (and hopefully several others) of treating oneself. It would be helpful for peer 
reviewers to identify the accuracy and clarity of the message. I am looking forward to continuing this project and receiving helpful peer feedback!
