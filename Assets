Prospective assets:
For the first direction
-	Plain pink or white (to serve as the background)
-	Soft serve ice cream in a cone
For the second direction
-	Plain pink or white (to serve as the background)
-	Hard serve ice cream in a dish
-	Silver spoon
I plan to obtain these images through Unsplash and use Font Squirrel for the word component while keeping in mind what I am able to use for this project.


Update:

I ended up choosing https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549395156-e0c1fe6fc7a5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=634&q=80
as my asset. I went in the direction of hard serve ice cream in a cone. I also downloaded the "Milkshake" font from FontSquirrel, but am still deciding if I am going to use this
as my final font. I am continuing to search for various fonts. 

- Still considering the font "Milkshake" on FontSquirrel, but still looking at other fonts. I have been focusing more on the image but will be shifting to the font.
